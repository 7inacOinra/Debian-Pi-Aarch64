The software will display the details of each drive or partition, such as its size, type, status, and protection mode.

The third step is to set a password and enable protection for your chosen drive or partition. You can use any combination of letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces for your password, but make sure it is strong and memorable. The software will automatically analyze the reliability of your password and give you feedback on how to improve it[^2^]. You can also choose the encryption algorithm (AES-256 or XTS-AES) and the hash function (SHA-512 or Whirlpool) for your data.
 
Once you have set your password, you can enable protection by clicking on the corresponding button. The software will ask you to confirm your action and warn you about the possible consequences of losing or forgetting your password. After that, the protection will be activated and your data will be encrypted and secured.
